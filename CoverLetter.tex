My name is Dan, and i have a M.Sc. in Engineering physics with a specialization in applied automatic control with experience in aviation and industrial machinery.
I am a natural leader and my main skills are focused on programming, automation, automatic control and mechatronics systems.
I believe the combination of a technical interest, love for programming and a desire to learn and challenge myself makes me a great candidate for the position as POSITION at COMPANY NAME.


Employed as a Flight Control Engineer in an unmanned aviation company, I have demonstrated strong learning skills and the ability to work in a versatile and challenging environment. 
My main responsibilities include being in charge of developing autonomous flight for several unmanned systems. 
Through studies, knowledge and determination I use my skills to bring fixed-wing and single rotor systems to achieve full autonomous flight, including take-off and landing. 
This by integrating autopilot hardware on in-house designed airframes, requiring programming, configuration and testing in a safe environment.
\newline
In my current position I have built a flight test organization from scratch, with focus on safety and results. 
This by setting up everything from planning, flight brief, execution, de-brief to post-flight analysis and data storing. Acting as Flight Test Engineer, UAV operator and Pilot in Command I have executed over 100 operations, both within and beyond visible line of sight, being in charge of flight test crews of up to 8 individuals.

%I am a hands-on software engineer, with a passion for learning and challenging myself.
%My main role as consultant has been to develop software to run on large industrial machinery.
%With a passion for learning and technology I often find myself building deep knowledge of an entire system.
%Thus resulting in being a key asset in a team and the person to turn to for ideas, know-how and to get subsystems to work together.
%Ease of learning new systems and a passion for problem solving has also made me an excellent troubleshooter, both electrical and software.
%I have also been highly involved in data analysis and data presentation when evaluating key functions in a development project.
%As a team player I am social, initiative, practical and eager to help.

%Tetra Pak Rig story
In my work I am reliable, result oriented and prefer to work methodically and efficient. 
These traits helped me lead software development for a test rig at Tetra Pak to complete within the deadline, although suffering delays in mechanical design. 
The utilization of simulation in MATLAB and Simulink helped to provide alternative  means of testing code along the development process. 
Working systematically and building reusable generic building blocks in software additionally aided the development and I am proud to claim the rig was operational before the deadline.

%%Student
%When a student, I balanced a rigorous course load and an evening theatre job to keep my economy stable.
%From the second year I also added extra courses to the curriculum to satisfy my hunger for learning, especially programming and other computer courses.
%Even though the extra heavy workload, I have always met with deadlines and have never failed a single exam.
%Graduate courses has been characterized by control, embedded programming, math and some extra courses in computer architecture. 
%My education and interests lead up to a thesis project were a combination of Matlab, Simulink, SimMechanics and Embedded Coder was used to model and program a walking hexapod robot.

I am interested in work that challenges me and at the same time continues to develop me.
I believe my skill-set, passion, attitude and management experience can be of great value to your organization.
Travelling brings cultural and intellectual experience which I view as a positive element.
\newline
Finally, I would like to thank you for taking the time to consider my credentials and I am looking forward to hearing from you.
